# Transaction Processor

A C++ console application that models and processes financial-style transactions using object-oriented design and a clean CMake-based build system.

This project focuses on backend-style transaction logic rather than real-world banking or payment infrastructure.

---

## Overview

The Transaction Processor is a lightweight, console-based application designed to simulate the handling of transactions.  
It demonstrates how transactions can be represented, validated, and processed in a structured and extensible way using C++.

The application is intended for learning and demonstration purposes and does not interact with real financial systems.

## Key Features

- Transaction data modelling using C++ classes
- Modular and maintainable code structure
- Clear separation between application entry point and business logic
